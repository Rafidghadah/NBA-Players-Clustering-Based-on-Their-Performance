## **Introduction**

Basketball players have traditionally been categorized into five specific positions, there are:

- Point Guard: Facilitating play-making and ball-handling.
- Shooting Guard: Focused on scoring, often from long-range.
- Small Forward: Versatile players with a balanced skill set.
- Power Forward: Combining strength and agility for scoring and defense.
- Center: Dominant presence in the paint, responsible for rebounds and rim protection.

However, the game of basketball evolves so fast that these traditional classifications are quickly becoming outdated. This study is an attempt to reclassify players into new groups based on personal performance.

## **Analysis Process**
The acquired data will undergo a data cleaning stage with the aim of improving the quality of clustering results. During this phase, a series of checks will be performed on the data. Firstly, we will verify whether there are any duplicate entries. Subsequently, we will examine the data for the presence of empty values, and finally, we will scrutinize it to identify any inaccuracies in the entered dataset.

Once the data successfully completes the data cleaning stage, it will proceed to the clustering stage. In this stage, we will use k-means clustering to establish new clusters for NBA players based on statistical information from the 2022â€“2023 season. Our next objective is to determine the optimal K value that generates the most meaningful clusters given the available data. Following this, we will conduct a thorough interpretation of the clustering results.
